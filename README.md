5. Install the Call PaLM API Securely extension from the [Firebase Extensions Marketplace](https://extensions.dev/extensions). Follow the on-screen instructions to configure the extension.

    __NOTE__: Your project must be on the Blaze (pay as you go) plan to install the extension.

6. Enable anonymous authentication for your Firebase project by returning to https://console.firebase.google.com and selecting _Build_ in the left panel. Then go to _Authentication > Sign-in method_ and make sure _Anonymous_ is enabled.
